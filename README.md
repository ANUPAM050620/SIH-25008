- **Emergency Protocol Management**: Digital storage and retrieval of safety procedures

**Key API Endpoints:**
- `/api/auth/login` - User authentication
- `/api/modules` - Educational content management
- `/api/alerts` - Emergency alert system
- `/api/protocols` - Safety procedure access
- `/api/assessments` - Testing and certification

### 2. Frontend Web Application
**Files: `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`**

Modern, responsive web interface featuring:

- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** capabilities for offline access
- **Multi-role Dashboard** for students, teachers, and administrators
- **Interactive Learning Modules** with gamification elements
- **Real-time Alert Display** with severity-based notifications
- **Mobile-first Responsive Design** supporting all device sizes
- **Accessibility Features** compliant with WCAG 2.1 standards

**Key Features:**
- Gamified learning experience with achievement systems
- Interactive disaster simulations and assessments
- Real-time emergency alert banner system
- Progress visualization with detailed analytics
- Multi-language support (English, Hindi, Punjabi)

### 3. Database Architecture
**File: `database_schema.sql`**

Comprehensive PostgreSQL database design including:

- **User Management**: Multi-role user system with institutional affiliations
- **Content Management**: Flexible educational module storage
- **Assessment Tracking**: Detailed progress and certification records
- **Emergency Management**: Alert systems and protocol storage
- **Gamification System**: Achievement tracking and point systems
- **Audit Logging**: Complete system activity monitoring

**Key Tables:**
- `users`, `institutions` - User and organizational management
- `educational_modules`, `user_progress` - Learning content and tracking
- `alerts`, `emergency_protocols` - Emergency management systems
- `assessments`, `achievements` - Testing and gamification

### 4. Educational Content System
**File: `sample_educational_content.json`**

Structured learning modules covering:

- **Fire Safety Basics**: Prevention, evacuation, and response procedures
- **Earthquake Preparedness**: Drop-Cover-Hold techniques and safety protocols
- **Flood Response**: Early warning systems and evacuation planning
- **Pandemic Preparedness**: Health emergency protocols and hygiene practices
- **Emergency Communication**: Alert systems and coordination procedures

Each module includes interactive elements, video content, simulations, and comprehensive assessments.

### 5. Deployment Configuration
**Files: `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile.backend`, `requirements.txt`**

Production-ready containerized deployment featuring:

- **Docker Orchestration**: Multi-service container management
- **Database Services**: PostgreSQL with automated backups
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for session management and performance
